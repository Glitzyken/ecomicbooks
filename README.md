<!-- # HOW TO CONTRIBUTE (especially for team members new to github)

1. Fork this project to your github repo
2. Clone the forked project to your local repo (pc/mac)
3. Open your pc/mac terminal and cd to the project directory
4. Run <code> npm install </code>
5. Open the project with your preferred code editor (I'd recommend VS Code)
6. Move the <code> 🔆config.env </code> file that you have been given to the project folder (make sure the file is on the same directory with app.js, package.js, server.js, etc.)
7. You can change the <code> 🔆config.env </code> file variables to fit your configuration if need be
8. Still on the <code> 🔆config.env </code> file. You can switch between <code> DATABASS= </code> variable and <code> DATABASS_LOCAL= </code> depending on the task required of you. If you are using <code> DATABASS= </code> variable, skip step 9
9. Import dev-data files to mongoDB locally
10. Do your changes or add to the code base (Only change or add something you are asked to do. Ultering someone else's code may cause confliction and ultimatley break the code.)
11. When you are done with your code for the moment and want to push it to your forked repo, run <code> git push -u origin master </code> (note that the -u flag is required just once and is no longer necessary for other subsequent push command)
12. If you are set to add you contribution to the team work, notify the team by leaving a comment in the pull request on the original repo. We'll tell you what to do next

THANKS FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION. YOU ARE VALUED BY THE TEAM.🤗 -->
